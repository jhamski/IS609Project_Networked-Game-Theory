Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma on a Graph.

The classic two person Prisoner's Dilemma. 

```{r}
nodes <- 20

g.1 <- degree.sequence.game(rep(2,nodes), method =  "vl")

#randomply select strategy
# 1 = defect, 2 = cooperate
V(g.1)$strategy <- sample(c(1,2), size = length(V(g.1)), replace = T)

V(g.1)[strategy == 1]$color <- 'red' # defect
V(g.1)[strategy == 2]$color <- 'blue' # cooperate
```

```{r}
plot(g.1)
```

Actually iterate through each node and figure out what the PD result is. Make sure all results average to the same thing. Then, re-do it for a different network, and different strategies. 

```{r}

iterations <- 25

for(i in 1:iterations){
  start.node <- as.numeric(sample(V(g.1), 1))
  opponents.cnt <- neighborhood.size(g.1, 1, start.node)
  
  opponents <- neighbors(g.1, start.node, mode="all")
  
  #defectors <- V(g.1)[strategy == 1]
  
  
}

```
